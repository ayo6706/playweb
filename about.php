I have 1 years commercial experience learnig with freinds from around the world, providing responsive <a href="#" title="Front-end Developer">front-end development</a> and <a href="#" title="WordPress Developer">WordPress websites</a>.</p>
      <div class="clear">

      <p>friends often approach me when they need a developer help who can provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsive Websites</li>
        <li>android development</li>
        <li>Front-end Development
          <ul>

            <li>Animation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.
      </p>
      <p>Often front-end development of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">My clients</a> have found that launching with a well considered and well developed front-end has saved them time and money and makes for a product that is consistently of high quality.
      </p>
      <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
      <p>I have many years experience as a 
        <a href="#">WordPress</a> and 
        <a href="#">front-end developer</a>, 
        creating responsive websites of a high quality.
      </p>
      <p>In my past experience as a freelancer and working for agencies I have also obtained an eye for detail and appreciation for design, knowledge of integrating with and developing server-side, as well as knowing how to efficiently project manage and work with clients and colleagues successfully.
      </p>
      <p>I now specialise in <a href="#">WordPress</a> and <a href="#">front-end development</a> but my knowledge of multiple fields allows me to work on a project with the full scope in mind; simplifying the process of our working together and producing a more cohesive experience for your users.

    <p>
      I create responsive websites that allow the user to experience your website in the best and most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. By working using progressive enhancement, your website is delivered with a responsive layout that can best make use of the space available on the smallest to largest devices. Cross browser compatibility is ensured by using feature detection so older browsers still in use today provide a solid experience, whilst modern browsers can go the next step and enhance a user’s time spent on your site.
    </p>
    <p>Writing semantic markup that is documented and easy to read means it can be maintained and scaled in the future, and allows co-workers to quickly work with it.
    </p>
    <p>Rather than create websites on a page-by-page basis, I instead consider each element of your screen-based designs as separate components that can exist elsewhere on a website; outside of the context of your design compositions. With these components I produce a style guide that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a project’s language and produce a more consistent user experience.
    </p>
    <p>My front-end build process involves the use of tools such as Sass, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, and NPM to speed up development.
    </p>
    <p>I can quickly and efficiently join your team using continuous-integration with methods and tools such as Git, Jenkins, Agile/Scrum, and test/behaviour driven development.

WordPress is the world’s most popular contact management system which I have many years of experience with. WordPress is extremely customisable via its API and third-party plugins; my experience enables me to make the most cost-effective decisions when it comes to choosing between a pre-made plugin or writing custom code. My focus when customising WordPress is on ease of use and maintainability; making sure you can manage your contact as simply and quickly as possible.</p><h3 id="design">Design</h3><div class="logos"><div class="logo"> <img src="img/ps.png" alt="ps" width="80" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3260"><strong>Photoshop</strong></div><div class="logo"> <img src="img/illustrator.jpg" alt="Illustrator" width="80" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3260"><strong>Illustrator</strong></div><div class="logo"> <img src="img/fw.png" alt="fw" width="80" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3258"><strong>Fireworks</strong></div><div class="logo"> <img src="img/sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch" width="80" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3260"><strong>Sketch</strong></div></div><p>I convert designs to high-performance code whilst respecting your designer’s compositions.
